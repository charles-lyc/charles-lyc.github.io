# Welcome to maker.moekoe

This is the GitHub Page providing some corresponding materials to most of my projects which can be found on my [Instagram Blog](https://www.instagram.com/maker.moekoe/).


In the future there will be great content to have a look at, but until now it is just a work in progress..

The latest updates to my projects can be found on my [Instagram Blog](https://www.instagram.com/maker.moekoe/).

But there are also some great projects on my [Instructables Page](https://www.instructables.com/member/moekoe/).

Also on my neglected [Thingiverse Page](https://www.thingiverse.com/makermoekoe/designs) you can find a few 3D-Printer parts, but because my printer is something like a wreck until now, I am unfortunately not able to keep it up to date.

Have fun doing arts and crafts
