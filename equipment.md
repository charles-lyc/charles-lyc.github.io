## Equipment

Some people from all over the world wide electronics community often ask me which tools I am using. Therefore I created a small list with some of my equipment.

# Soldering iron

My soldering iron is surely the oldest electronic tool which you can find on my work desk, but it is working awfully good and the results are hugely satisfying, so I just do not need to replace it. I am talking about the ELV LS 50. The soldering tip I use is a 0.8mm one. Of course it was exchanged sometimes during the whole time but the station is about 10 years old and as I said it is working very well until now.

# Reflow station

In the end of the year 2018 I started to create my own pcbs with some SMD components on it. Soldering these components in the size of 0603 is very tricky and you have to need a steady hand. For the sake of convenience I bought a 852D+ rework station which includes a reflow hot air gun and and normal soldering iron. The difference between this one and my small hot air gun which I have used before is that you can regulate both the airflow and the heat. As you could have seen in one of my soldering videos on instagram the airflow of my old hot air gun was in general to high because sometimes the small components were blown away from the PCB.

# Dispenser
